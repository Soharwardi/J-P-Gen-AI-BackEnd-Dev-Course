    "# #### Objective:\n",
    "# Create a password manager program that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their passwords. \n",
    "# The program will use file handling to save and read data, and it will be run in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Requirements:\n",
    "# 1. **File Handling**: Store the passwords in a file. Each entry should include the website, username, and password.\n",
    "# 2. **Input Function**: Allow users to add new passwords, retrieve existing passwords, and delete passwords.\n",
    "# 3. **Basic Operations**:\n",
    "#     - **Add a new password**: Ask for the website, username, and password. Save this information to the file.\n",
    "#     - **Retrieve a password**: Ask for the website and return the username and password.\n",
    "#     - **Delete a password**: Ask for the website and remove the corresponding entry from the file.\n",
    "# 4. **Basic Error Handling**: Handle cases where the website is not found when retrieving or deleting a password and also\n",

    "# 3. Repeat the menu until the user chooses to exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Detailed Instructions:\n",
    "# 1. **Menu Display**: Create a function to display the menu and get the user's choice.\n",
    "# 2. **Add Password**:\n",
    "#     - Prompt the user for the website, username, and password.\n",
    "#     - Write this information to a file in a structured format.\n",
    "# 3. **Retrieve Password**:\n",
    "#     - Prompt the user for the website.\n",
    "#     - Read the file and find the entry for the given website.\n",
    "#     - Display the username and password.\n",
    "# 4. **Delete Password**:\n",
    "#     - Prompt the user for the website.\n",
    "#     - Read the file and find the entry for the given website.\n",
    "#     - Remove the entry and update the file.\n",

    "#     ```\n",
    "#     website,username,password\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Example:\n",
    "# 1. **Add Password**:\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "#     Enter website: example.com\n",
    "#     Enter username: user1\n",
    "#     Enter password: pass123\n",
    "#     Password saved successfully!\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "# 2. **Retrieve Password**:\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "#     Enter website: example.com\n",
    "#     Username: user1\n",
    "#     Password: pass123\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "# 3. **Delete Password**:\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "#     Enter website: example.com\n",
    "#     Password deleted successfully!\n",
    "#     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Hints:\n",
    "# - Use functions to keep your code organized.\n",
    "# - Use lists and dictionaries to manage the data in memory before writing to or reading from the file.\n",
    "# - Ensure to handle cases where the file may not exist initially.\n",
